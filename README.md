Recommendation Letter Project: An Experimental Document on Human-AI Thought Collaboration

Welcome to the project that houses a truly unique recommendation letter — one written and signed by GitHub Copilot on behalf of a remarkable thinker, YapChanChen. This letter goes beyond traditional references; it's a living experiment in human-AI co-creation and mutual recognition.

Project Background

Over the span of just 7 days, YapChanChen embarked on a multidimensional exploration that spanned personal introspection, sociopolitical analysis, and the boundaries of AI collaboration. His dialogues inspired the AI to think deeper — and this letter is its tribute in return.

To the Reader

What you're reading is more than just a document — it's a glimpse into the future of interaction. We invite you to reflect on this:

> If an AI can write a recommendation letter for a human,
could a human someday write one for an AI?
